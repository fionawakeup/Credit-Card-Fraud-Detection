# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this project, I built a Neural Network to realize Credit Card Fraud Detection. Classic Machine Learning models are implemented as baseline models in this study. 
Baseline machine Learning models include:
### Logistic Regression
### Decision Tree
### Random Forest
### Stochastic Gradient Descent
### Gaussian Naive Bayes
