# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
In this project, I built a Neural Network to realize Credit Card Fraud Detection. Classic Machine Learning models are implemented as baseline models in this study. 
Baseline machine Learning models include:
### Logistic Regression
### Decision Tree
### Random Forest
### Stochastic Gradient Descent
### Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Data Explotary Analysis
I checked the distribution of all 28 features. 

## Data preprocessing
I used correlation matrix to pick features.
